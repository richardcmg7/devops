Dear Erick,

Good day. I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to address your queries regarding our versioning strategy, administrative access, and access revocation procedures. My apologies for the delayed response; I have been in discussions with the team throughout the week to ensure our recommendations are precise and that we are adjusting our documentation accordingly.

We are currently in the development phase, actively refining our processes and exploring the most effective implementation methods within our organization. We are also focused on taking actions that align with governance execution.

Additionally, we are in the process of defining and adjusting our deployment strategies. These will be continually evaluated to enhance team performance, continuous software delivery, and operational efficiency.

In response to your questions:

    With the 'Git-flow' strategy, developers are responsible for their actions in the initial environment (Development), where image lifting is automated with pull requests to the dev branch. We aim for an automatic integration of these pull requests into the Dev branch to eliminate any barriers.

Since we do not yet have a testing system in place (which we are working to establish), we have an intermediary step where the team designates a responsible individual for integrating changes into the Dev branch of a specific repository.

For Demo or a stable development version, a team member will be tasked with creating the branch and defining the current version, which should also be automated.

    We are in the process of defining and obtaining approval for three individuals who will lead the administration. This is to streamline the number of Organization Administrators to an optimal and manageable number.

    As for access revocation, I understand that it should be an integral part of the company's offboarding process. I am currently consulting with the relevant departments to review how this can be effectively implemented.

By next week, I will share an update with the discussed changes for your validation.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we refine these processes. Your input is invaluable, and I assure you that we are taking all necessary steps to address your concerns comprehensively.

Best regards,
